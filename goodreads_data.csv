Not too much detail. I don’t even know what the characters actually looked like. Nothing was ever really explored in full. Quick read but found myself getting bored at the end. Oh well! I like Persephone though she’s cool. Hades was also such a little baby boy so sweet and delicate. Definitely a unique Greek Mythology retelling I haven’t really seen anything like it. <br/><br/>I’m also realizing that the FAF series is just Hades and Persephone in a different font. A wayyyyy better font if you ask me though. <br/><br/>I actually only bought this book because it was next to the only outlet in Waterstones and I felt awk about standing there charging my phone so I started to fake read this book. <br/><br/>TTPD — But Daddy I Love Him,,,1,0

I understand why we needed to world build so hard because it made the worlds colliding 100000s times more impactful. The ups and downs then ups again of the relationships in this book were what made it one of the best books I’ve ever read. Truly the love and devotion each character comes to develop for one another is unlike anything else. So realistic and inspiring it makes me reflect and appreciate my own friendships. Makes you realize that the world could go to utter shit but if you have the right people by you then nothing even matters and you can get through the hard shit!!<br/><br/>That takeaway right there is why books rock!!!!!! <br/><br/>There were some lines that hit so hard I had to take a moment to recover.

I knew almost 50% of the way through that this would be a 4(.5) star book. Though it was engaging, I didn’t feel as passionate about getting through it as I did Fourth Wing. IMO there were too many subplots going on and though the author did a great job tying them in throughout the end of the book, it was just all a bit much to keep up with. Some of these subplots were also a bit anticlimactic. With that being said, I do think these books are extremely detailed and well thought out. I really have come to love the characters and the relationship development over the course of the story. Per usual, the last few pages left me absolutely gagged for about 5 minutes after closing the book. The author has managed the art of cliff hangers that is for sure. I will be pre ordering Onyx Storm ",,,1,0
